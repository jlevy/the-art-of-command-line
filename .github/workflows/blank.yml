Deferred Revenues and Remaining Performance Obligations We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Our total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $2.3 billion, of which $1.8 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020. Additionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts, primarily related to Google Cloud, for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues, also referred to as remaining performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations include related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, (ii) cancellable contracts, and (iii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. As of December 31, 2020, the amount not yet recognized as revenues from these commitments is $29.8 billion. We expect to recognize approximately half over the next CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Parenthetical) - $ / shares        Dec. 31, 2020        Dec. 31, 2019

Deferred Revenues and Remaining Performance Obligations We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Our total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $2.3 billion, of which $1.8 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020. Additionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts, primarily related to Google Cloud, for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues, also referred to as remaining performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations include related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, (ii) cancellable contracts, and (iii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. As of December 31, 2020, the amount not yet recognized as revenues from these commitments is $29.8 billion.

Deferred Revenues and Remaining Performance Obligations We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Our total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $2.3 billion, of which $1.8 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020. Additionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts, primarily related to Google Cloud, for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues, also referred to as remaining performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations include related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, (ii) cancellable contracts, and (iii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. As of December 31, 2020, the amount not yet recognized as revenues from these commitments is $29.8 billion. We expect to recognize approximately half over the next CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Parenthetical) - $ / shares        Dec. 31, 2020        Dec. 31, 2019

Deferred Revenues and Remaining Performance Obligations We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Our total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $2.3 billion, of which $1.8 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ending December 31, 2020. Additionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts, primarily related to Google Cloud, for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues, also referred to as remaining performance obligations. Remaining performance obligations include related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, (ii) cancellable contracts, and (iii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. As of December 31, 2020, the amount not yet recognized as revenues from these commitments is $29.8 billion. We expect to recognize approximately half over the next CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Parenthetical) - $ / shares        Dec. 31, 2020        Dec. 31, 2019

Morningstar’s Behavioral Insights Team researches savings and investing behavior to help individual investors and their ecosystem avoid common behavioral biases, and has published books and articles on the topic of applying behavioral science to digital platforms. Because we offer an extensive line of products for individual investors, professional financial advisors, and institutional clients, we have a broad view on the RFI and the assessment of market practices associated with the use of digital engagement practices (DEPs). This letter contains: 1) a summary of our views; 2) a description of a Morningstar survey on a nationally representative sample of Americans about their use of trading apps and exposure to DEPs; and 3) detailed answers to selected questions posed in the RFI. We utilize our survey responses to address some of these questions and present specific findings in our answers. The survey consists of two parts: a screener for demographic information, attached as Appendix B, and the complete set of questions about individual experiences and views of DEPs, attached as Appendix C. 1 SEC. 2021.
